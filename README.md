# Time_Series_MoG_Clustering <br />
This is a uni-variate time-series data clustering method based on the paper *Gaussian Mixture Models for Time Series Modelling, Forecasting, and Interpolation* by E Eirola et al. There is a modification of the Mixutre of Gaussian such that the algorithm could not be produced by calling existing MoG packages (say, sk-learn). To solve the problem the author write a MoG model from the basics and vectorized the operations as possible to speed up the computations. <br />
